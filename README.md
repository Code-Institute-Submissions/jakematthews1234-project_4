# Jake's Artwork
### Welcome to my final project submission for Code-Institute. In this project i was tasked with creating a full stack project using Django and other forms of code. For my project idea I decided to create a website that sold artwork. 
### This full stack website is capable of storing data within a database and displaying it on the front end.  I created the ability for users to create an account, which is required to purchase artwork. I also created a blog within the website for users to read. There is also an option for users to purchase the artwork, which is done using Stripe.

# UX Design
### This site was created with the intention of allowing users to purchase artwork created by 'me'. With this in mind, my website is typically aimed at young adults to elderly, however younger generations may also view the artwork, so I made sure it was user friendly to all ages. Typically users who go onto my site are either wishing to view artwork, which is easily done on the homepage or on the artwork page, or purchase artwork, which is also easily done through the click of view details, and then purchase. 






# User Stories

#### Joseph is doing a project on local artists within his area, and wants to find out information on an artists life.
* My website would make it easy for Joseph to do research on a local artist as my website holds a blog section, which would tell a story of my journey as an artist, in a daily blog style format. 

#### Margaret is an elderly woman who wishes to purchase some new artwork for her home. She isnt very technology smart and so wants a website she can easily navigate without much problems. 
* My website would make it easy for Margaret to purchase artwork for her home as my website was designed to be easily navigated. Artwork can be purchased from the homepage of my website, making it incredibly easily navigated. 

#### Lauren is currently sitting her exams in art, and is researching trying to find inspiration for her final piece of work.
* My website would be great for Lauren as it has multiple pieces of artwork available for her to take inspiration from, and using the blog, she can gain an understanding of why that piece of artwork was created, with my inspiration behind it. 

# Features
* one of my features on my website includes the ability to sign up/create an account. This feature allows for users to purchase artwork, and if I was to have had more time, users would have also had the chance to leave likes/comments on each artwork so that they could discuss the artwork between themselves.

* Another feature of my website is the ability to purchase pieces of artwork easily through online payment. This feature was crucial as the true intent of the website was to allow consumers to buy artwork. 

* A further feature of my website is the navigation bar. This was created to allow users easy access to all the website has to offer, with a simple click of a button. This was done to make information architecture high.

* Another feature of my website is the comments section. This section allows for users to leave comments on any piece of artwork. Whether that be a positive comment, or a constructive comment.

* A final feature of my website is the like option. This option allows for any user to like any piece of artwork. With this in mind, my site is set so that the most liked artwork appears first, making it easier for users to see the more popular artwork. 

# Future Ideas
* One feature I would have implemented had this site been a real running site would be a system in which the comments can be moderated. This would be done with the ability of a report button, would anyone leave a comment that is deemed rude or inappropriate. This would tie in with users displaying their own artwork. 

* Another idea I would have implemented had i had enough time would be the ability to "add to bucketlist". This feature would be where users would be able to save their favourite pieces of artwork to their accounts, displaying them on their profiles.

* A final idea I would have created would be the ability to view profiles and share artwork. This feature would allow for users to add their own creations to their profile for others to see, comment on and like. This would create a feel of a community within the website, which would give users the ability to gain recognition, and also give them another reason to return to the site more regularly.
